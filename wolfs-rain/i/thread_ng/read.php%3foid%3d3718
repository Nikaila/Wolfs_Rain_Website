English mirror site<br />
BakaF03/20 22:27<br />
I've been thinking... since this Anime is so popular outside Japan, maybe someone should setup a mirror English site (properly translated English!) so everyone can enjoy all the information that Japanese fans have access to, without the language barrier.<br />
<br />
Of course, this will be a huge task to undertake considering the amount of things here to rebuild. I'm sure they won't mind people doing this since what we're really doing is expanding the world of Wolf Rain outside of Japan.<br />
<br />
I'm willing to help out with any translation if anyone else is thinking along the same lines and need a translator to help. Translation from Japanese to English and Chinese.<br />
